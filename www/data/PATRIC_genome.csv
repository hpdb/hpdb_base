While analyzing the spatial distribution of the GFP- and tdTomato-expressing isogenic strains in co-infections, we discovered that the two isolates are equally fit and identical in every manner except for differences in distribution in the gastric glands. In particular, we have consistently found that the GFP strain dominates in the transition zone glands in comparison to the tdTomato strain. We propose to conduct whole genome sequencing to identify genetic differences that could explain these differences in gastric gland distribution. In addition, we isolated multiple tdTomato clones from the initial transformation reaction and competed these with the GFP strain as co-infections. We discovered that some tdTomato clones either outcompeted or were outcompeted by the GFP strain. We propose that whole genome sequencing onthese tdTomato clones will help us discover novel factors important for fitness during gastric colonization . We also aim to conduct in vivo competition experiments between WT and mutants in important virulence factors. We previously described an H. pylori chemotaxis regulatory protein ChePep that is important for the ability of the bacteria to colonize the gastric glands. The ChePep deletion mutant colonizes mice to similar levels as WT and is found in the surface mucus, but does not colonize the gastric antral glands. These results suggest that sensing and responding to host environmental signals via chemotaxis play important roles in gland colonization. Furthermore, in competition, WT H. pylori completely outcompete the ChePep mutant, suggesting that gland colonization confers an important fitness advantage. We have generated differentially fluorescent mutant strains in ChePep, the chemoreceptors, and several other important H. pylori virulence factors.We are currently competing these mutants against differentially marked WT bacteria in co-infections to examine their fate and distribution in the gastric glands. This has never been done for any virulence factor in H. pylori, and has the potential to shed light on the roles of important virulence factors in fitness and gland colonization.

H. pylori infection stimulates the production of lymphoid infiltrates, which leads to the formation of acquired MALT in the gastric mucosa. As a result of chronic immunological stimulation, infiltrating B-cells actively proliferate and occasionally undergo malignant transformation because of the acquisition of genetic abnormalities. So far, the roles of major known virulence factors of H. pylori in MALT lymphomagenesis remained controversial. In the present report, we presented the genome sequences of three H. pylori strains ML1, ML2, and ML3, which were isolated from three patients with gastric MALT lymphoma, respectively.

Currently, FDA-ARGOS microbial genomes are generated in 3 phases. Generally: •Phase 1 entails collection of a previously identified microbe and nucleic acid extraction. •Phase 2, the microbial nucleic acids are sequenced and de novo assembled using Illumina and Pac Biosequencing platforms at the Institute for Genome Sciences disclaimer icon at the University of Maryland (UMD-IGS). •Phase 3, the assembled genomes are vetted by an ID-NGS subject matter expert working group consisting of FDA personnel and collaborators and the data are deposited in NCBI databases. The FDA-ARGOS genomes meet the quality metrics for reference-grade genomes for regulatory use. FDA-ARGOS reference genomes have been de novo assembled with high depth of base coverage and placed within a pre-established phylogenetic tree. Each microbial isolate in the database is covered at a minimum of 20X over 95 percent of the assembled core genome.

H. pylori infection stimulates the production of lymphoid infiltrates, which leads to the formation of acquired MALT in the gastric mucosa. As a result of chronic immunological stimulation, infiltrating B-cells actively proliferate and occasionally undergo malignant transformation because of the acquisition of genetic abnormalities. So far, the roles of major known virulence factors of H. pylori in MALT lymphomagenesis remained controversial. In the present report, we presented the genome sequences of three H. pylori strains ML1, ML2, and ML3, which were isolated from three patients with gastric MALT lymphoma, respectively. Whole genome sequencing was performed using the 454 pyrosequencing technology. The availability of these genome sequences would provide the research community with a resource for detailed investigation into genetic elements that contribute to lymphomagenesis by comparative genomic approaches.",,,,,,,,"2017-12-29T17:26:43.220Z","2017-12-29T17:26:43.220Z"

With funding support from FDA’s Office of Counterterrorism and Emerging Threats (OCET) and DoD, the FDA-ARGOS team are initially collecting and sequencing 2000 microbes that include biothreat microorganisms, common clinical pathogens and closely related species. Currently, FDA-ARGOS microbial genomes are generated in 3 phases. Generally:  Phase 1 entails collection of a previously identified microbe and nucleic acid extraction. Phase 2, the microbial nucleic acids are sequenced and de novo assembled using Illumina and PacBio sequencing platforms at the Institute for Genome Sciences at the University of Maryland (UMD-IGS). Phase 3, the assembled genomes are vetted by an ID-NGS subject matter expert working group consisting of FDA personnel and collaborators and the data are deposited in NCBI databases.   The FDA-ARGOS genomes meet the quality metrics for reference-grade genomes for regulatory use. FDA-ARGOS reference genomes have been de novo assembled with high depth of base coverage and placed within a pre-established phylogenetic tree. Each microbial isolate in the database is covered at a minimum of 20X over 95 percent of the assembled core genome. Furthermore, sample specific metadata, raw reads, assemblies, annotation and details of the bioinformatics pipeline are available.","collected_by:ATCC < MJ Jones < M.J.

With funding support from FDA’s Office of Counterterrorism and Emerging Threats (OCET) and DoD, the FDA-ARGOS team are initially collecting and sequencing 2000 microbes that include biothreat microorganisms, common clinical pathogens and closely related species. Currently, FDA-ARGOS microbial genomes are generated in 3 phases. Generally:  Phase 1 entails collection of a previously identified microbe and nucleic acid extraction. Phase 2, the microbial nucleic acids are sequenced and de novo assembled using Illumina and PacBio sequencing platforms at the Institute for Genome Sciences at the University of Maryland (UMD-IGS). Phase 3, the assembled genomes are vetted by an ID-NGS subject matter expert working group consisting of FDA personnel and collaborators and the data are deposited in NCBI databases.   The FDA-ARGOS genomes meet the quality metrics for reference-grade genomes for regulatory use. FDA-ARGOS reference genomes have been de novo assembled with high depth of base coverage and placed within a pre-established phylogenetic tree. Each microbial isolate in the database is covered at a minimum of 20X over 95 percent of the assembled core genome. Furthermore, sample specific metadata, raw reads, assemblies, annotation and details of the bioinformatics pipeline are available.","collected_by:ATCC < NCTC < CS Goodwin and DI Annear < H Royce",99.9,99.6,100,,,"Good","2018-05-30T20:32:14.577Z","2018-05-30T20:32:14.577Z"

The human stomach, a complex, compartmentalized, ecological niche, is the only known natural reservoir of H. pylori. Genetic changes of H. pylori during chronic infection in vivo have been previously described by whole-genome sequencing during both early stage of infection, and long-term colonization. However, the extent of bacterial population variation inside the gastric environment has not been extensively investigated. The aim of this study was to determine the population structure of H. pylori within individual stomachs and to look for evidence of local adaptation to anatomical regions. Gastric biopsies were obtained from the antrum, corpus and fundus regions of 16 H. pylori-infected adults. Ten single H. pylori colonies were isolated per biopsy, and draft genome sequences of all isolates were obtained (Illumina MiSeq technology). Additional reference genomes were generated by Single Molecule, Real-Time (SMRT) sequencing.","collected_by:Otto von Guericke University, Dept. of Gastroenterology, Hepatology and Infectious Diseases, Magdeburg, Germany",99.5,99.4,,,,"Good","2019-09-29T23:54:16.883Z","2019-09-29T23:54:16.883Z"
